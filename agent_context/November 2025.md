### BTC
Biases:
1. Daily
    - Mixed-bearish
    - Bearish FVG on the Daily chart. Is this a draw on liquidity?
    - No liquidity (i.e. swing levels) taken on Daily chart.
2. 4h
    - Mixed-bearish
    - Pull back took out lots of SSL, perhaps it can reverse? A bearish FVG (different from the one on the Daily chart) was formed in the move downward.
3. 1h
    - Bearish
    - Price consistently forming lower highs, with a recent swing high being swept and price proceeds to fall downwards, taking lots of SSL on the 1h.
    - Swing low formed after big drop, then a (lower) swing high, and price just now broke last week's low (huge liquidity pool).
        - Reversal? Must see confirmation first.

<strong>Overall Bias: Bearish</strong>

### Trade 1 Review
Trade 1 was a hefty loss. I was pennies away from my take-profit level but it did not quite meet it.

I figured price would keep going lower, and I was targeting the recent low on the 15m chart.

Price got super close to that level but didn't take out that low, and it reversed instead. 
I had my stop-loss above the recent 5m high that formed right after the big draw-down, and I was taken out.

### Trade 2 Review
This trade was a win, both financially and because I actually had a draw on liquidity and I already saw the rejection following the SSL sweep.

I see that price actually wicked through the FVG (which was my draw on liquidity; I had my TP at the top of the FVG) on the 15m chart. Could it also reverse from here and actually go lower?

### Trade 3 Review
I went short on BTC again because I saw the bearish momentum (I ditched that expectation of bullish reversal) and price pulling into a premium after filling a FVG, so I anticipated that price would reverse after taking that internal liquidity, which it did. 

I will admit that I closed my position early. 100% paper hands. The chart didn't show momentum slowing, so it could actually hit my TP, but I closed early and took profit because I wasn't confident.

### Trade 1 Review
I entered short because ETH doesn't have a close liquidity pool below, so I expected it to continue falling

The trade was profitable (thank God) and this one really had all the strengths aligned:
- HTFs were all bearish
- 1h dealing range was clear, price was in a premium and I went short just before it entered discount range. 

Not the cleanest entry, but we still got a lot of good things from this trade.
