# STRATEGY

<!-- meta: core -->
## Objective
Trade **with** the prevailing structure only, from **discount** (longs) or **premium** (shorts), using **swing structure, BOS/CHoCH, liquidity pools, displacement, and FVGs** as confirmation.

## Core Concepts

<!-- meta: core, concept=market-structure -->
### Market Structure Fundamentals
**Swing High**: Highest high in the middle, lower highs on both sides  
**Swing Low**: Lowest low in the middle, higher lows on both sides

**Market Structure Shift Sequence:**
1. **Igniting move** - Initial BOS that breaks a swing point
2. **Retracement** - Price pulls back within the previous range
3. **Swing formation** - New swing low (bullish) or swing high (bearish) forms
4. **Confirmation** - Third candle above/below the swing is taken out

**Fractal Nature**: The same swing patterns and structure shifts occur on all timeframes (W → D → 4H → 1H → 15m → 5m). What happens on one timeframe repeats on another.

**Key Principle**: Trade in the direction where higher timeframe structure aligns with lower timeframe structure. When both align, probability increases dramatically.

### Draw on Liquidity

**Core Concept**: The market moves from liquidity pool to liquidity pool like a pendulum. Your need to identify which pool was just taken and which pool is next.

**Why This Matters**: Understanding the draw tells you where price is likely headed, giving you directional bias and profit targets. The market doesn't move randomly—it hunts stops and resting orders.

**Liquidity Pools (in order of significance):**
1. **Previous Day High/Low** - Primary magnets in trending markets
2. **Session Highs/Lows** - Asia, London, New York session extremes
3. **Weekly/Monthly Highs/Lows** - Higher timeframe liquidity
4. **Equal Highs/Lows** - Obvious levels where stops cluster
5. **Swing Points** - Recent swing highs/lows where stops rest

**The Pattern:**
- In **bullish structure**, the objective is to continuously run **previous day highs** until met with enough liquidity to reverse
- In **bearish structure**, the objective is to continuously run **previous day lows** until reversal
- After taking one side's liquidity, price seeks the opposite side
- After running external liquidity, expect retracement to internal liquidity

**Session Dynamics:**
- **Asian session lows** in bullish markets = liquidity grab before seeking higher prices
- After liquidity is taken, look for **shift in market structure** on lower timeframe (1m/3m/5m)
- The shift after the liquidity grab confirms the start of the next leg toward the draw

**Trading With The Draw:**
1. Identify current HTF trend/structure
2. Determine which liquidity pool was just taken
3. Identify the next pool in the direction of structure
4. Enter after liquidity sweep + structural confirmation
5. Target the next draw on liquidity

### Internal vs External Range Liquidity

**Why This Framework Exists**: It provides a two-tier target system and explains why price retraces after big moves. This is essential for layered profit-taking and understanding post-breakout behavior.

**External Range Liquidity:**
- The **swing high** and **swing low** that define a price range
- The absolute boundaries—the endpoints
- Think: "outside" the range
- When price sweeps external liquidity, it's taking out stops at range extremes

**Internal Range Liquidity:**
- **Imbalances/FVGs** that exist within a price range
- Areas of inefficient price delivery
- Think: "inside" the range
- Price doesn't like leaving inefficiencies—it seeks to rebalance them

**The Cycle (How To Use This):**

1. **External → Internal:**
   - Price takes out swing high/low (external)
   - Fast move leaves imbalance behind (internal created)
   - Price pulls back to fill the imbalance (seeking internal)
   - **Entry opportunity**: After external is taken, enter the pullback to internal

2. **Internal → External:**
   - Price rebalances imbalance (internal filled)
   - Price now rotates to opposite external liquidity
   - **Profit target**: After entering at internal, target the opposite external

**Identifying The Pattern:**

**External**: Look for swing highs/lows—use the 3-candle pattern (highest/lowest in middle, opposite on sides)

**Internal**: Look for FVGs/imbalances—3 candles where top of first and bottom of third don't overlap (bullish FVG), or bottom of first and top of third don't overlap (bearish FVG)

**Multi-Timeframe Application:**
- On **4H**: External taken → look for 15m internal to fill for entry
- On **15m**: External taken → look for 5m internal to fill for entry  
- On **1H range**: After taking 1H swing low (external), target 1H imbalance above (internal), then opposite 1H swing high (external)

**Why Price "Breathes":**
After taking external liquidity (aggressive move), price often retraces to rebalance the inefficiency (imbalance) it left behind. This isn't weakness—it's the setup for the next leg. The retracement into internal liquidity is where you enter, targeting the next external.

**Practical Application:**
- After a **sweep low + bullish displacement**, look for the **FVG created during displacement** = internal liquidity draw for your entry
- After **filling that FVG**, price seeks **previous swing high** = external liquidity target
- After **taking that swing high**, price may retrace to **new FVG left behind** = next internal, setting up next trade

## Timeframes
- **HTFs to align:** Weekly → Daily → 4H → 1H
- **Execution:** 15m or 5m (refine on 1–3m only after confirmation)

---

<!-- meta: concept=market-structure -->
## Bias & Dealing Range
1. **Define HTF bias:** 
   - Bullish if successive **HH/HL** and last significant **BOS up** holds across W/D/4H/1H
   - Bearish if successive **LL/LH** and last significant **BOS down** holds across W/D/4H/1H
2. **Set dealing range on the 1H:** most recent **swing low ↔ swing high** that produced the HTF BOS
3. **Location filter:** 
   - **Longs only** while price is **below 50%** of the 1H dealing range (**discount**)
   - **Shorts only** while price is **above 50%** of the 1H dealing range (**premium**)

## Liquidity & Confirmation
- **Liquidity pools:** Prior day H/L, session H/L (Asia/London/NY), equal highs/lows, obvious swing stops
- **Draw on liquidity**: Identify which pool was just taken and which is next in the direction of structure
- **Confirm with displacement:** A **BOS/CHoCH** on the execution TF **that creates an FVG** signals strong institutional flow (A+ setup)
- **Internal liquidity**: After external sweep, the FVG created becomes the pullback target for entry

---

<!-- meta: concept=entry -->
## Long Setup (mirror for shorts)

**HTF Alignment:**
1. HTF bias **bullish** (HH/HL on W/D/4H/1H)
2. 1H price **in discount** (below 50% of dealing range)
3. **Draw on liquidity** identified above: PDH, session high, or 1H range high (external)

**Entry Trigger:**
4. Price **sweeps sell-side** (Asia low/PDL/equal lows/swing low) ← taking external liquidity
5. **Displacement up** creating **FVG** (BOS confirmed) ← institutional flow confirmed
6. Price pulls back into **FVG** or order block ← seeking internal liquidity for entry
7. **Entry confirmation**: 
   - Swing low forms (lowest low in middle, higher lows on sides)
   - Price breaks above the high of the 3rd candle with strong close
   - Alternative: Strong close above previous candle high with conviction

**Management:**
8. **Invalidation:** Clean break below the sweep low or below the OB that launched displacement
9. **First target (internal)**: Next FVG/imbalance on path to external draw
10. **Final targets (external):** Session high → PDH → 1H range high
11. **Scaling:** Reduce risk at 1R or first internal target, trail stops under higher lows/OB, run remainder to external

## Short Setup (bearish)
- Same logic inverted: 
  - **Premium location** (above 50% of 1H range)
  - **Buy-side sweep** (PDH/session high/swing high) ← external taken
  - **BOS down + FVG** ← displacement
  - Enter pullback to **FVG/OB** ← internal liquidity
  - Targets: **PDL → session low → 1H range low** (external)

---

<!-- meta:core -->
## Do-Not-Trade Filters
- HTF misalignment (any W/D/4H/1H in conflict)
- No displacement (weak breaks without FVG creation)
- Entries **mid-range** (around 50%) without discount/premium edge
- News spikes that haven't produced a **clean structural read**
- "Fake shifts": Displacement that occurs while **leaving the draw liquidity intact**
  - Example: Bullish BOS + FVG forms, but PDH remains untouched above = likely fake shift designed to create liquidity below for the real move up
