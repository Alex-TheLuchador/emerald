ICT/SMC (Inner Circle Trader / Smart Money Concepts) Module

This module contains core ICT trading strategy detection and analysis functions:
- Swing high/low detection
- Market structure analysis (HH/HL vs LL/LH)
- Dealing range calculation
- Higher timeframe alignment checking
- Fair Value Gap (FVG) detection
- Break of Structure (BOS) / Change of Character (CHoCH) detection
- Liquidity pool tracking
- Setup validation

Philosophy:
Markets move from liquidity to liquidity. Price hunts clustered orders at key
structural levels. We trade WITH higher timeframe structure by entering on
lower timeframe pullbacks into discount/premium zones.
